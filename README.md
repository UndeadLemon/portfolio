# Portfolio

A portfolio site built in flutter.

## Information

This project is a portfolio website, and currently (perhaps always) a work in progress.

## Why Flutter?

Because it's interesting to learn! Javascript is something I currently feel more comfortable with, but Dart seems like an interesting language, and any attempt to make something is also a good time to learn something.

## Demo

Coming soon! At time of writing, I'm just initializing the project. If you're seeing this, it just means I haven't had time to create a demo - but, it also means there will probably be one soon!
